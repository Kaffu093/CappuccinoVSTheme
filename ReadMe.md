This is my personal Visual Studio Code theme, based on the blue color because it's my favorite color. I hope you like it!

## Preview üì∑

## Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è

This theme is originally created for Visual Studio Code and was converted to Visual Studio with the help of the
Theme Converter for Visual Studio, so all credits of this tool goes to the team that created it.

Also this mean that the theme may not be 100% faithful to the original theme.

## Compatibility üìã

I use this theme as my personal and main theme in my projects, so I try to make it compatible with the most used
languages and frameworks. But if you find some issues with the theme, you can open an issue or a pull request,
I'll be so grateful!
